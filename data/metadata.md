Title: The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the national telehealth service for triage and referral in Sweden

Keywords: telehealth, healthcare services, Covid-19

Abstract: Telehealth, the provision of medicine through digital communication has been proposed as a potential solution to meet the increasing demand for healthcare, particularly in the setting of the Covid-19 pandemic. Sweden has an established national telehealth service for triage and referral by phone (1177) since 2013 which has the potential to meet this increasing demand. However, little is known about the development and retention in demand during and after the pandemic in Sweden. Our objective was to investigate the utilization of the national telehealth service in Sweden before, during and after the pandemic in relation to ED visits. This was a retrospective cross-sectional study of calls to the national telehealth service in Sweden. We collected the number of calls, number of answered calls and visits to emergency departments (ED) in Sweden from 2017 through 2021, aggregated by month. Difference in number of calls and visits was analyzed using the student's t-test for related samples. Data was collected from all 21 health care regions in Sweden serving 10.5 million citizens. The average number of monthly calls was 48 (SD 10) calls per 1000 citizens. The first month of the pandemic, March 2020, had the highest monthly calls per capita during the whole study period of 62 (diff 14, 95% CI 9 - 19, p<0.001). During the first three months of the pandemic, monthly calls increased with 22% (52.7 vs 43.2) compared to 2019 (diff 9.5, 95% CI -28 - 9, p=0.17). There was a 17% increase in calls for the whole year of 2020 compared to 2019 (49.2 vs 41.9, diff 7.3, 95% CI 3 - 11, p=0.002). Capacity, defined as the answer ratio, showed a negative correlation with demand (r=0.75, p<0.001). There was a 17% increase in the number of calls to the national telehealth service during the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic suggesting that the community will turn to a telehealth system in a healthcare crisis. The lack of capacity to meet the increasing demand may limit the effects of the telehealth service on the healthcare system as a whole.
